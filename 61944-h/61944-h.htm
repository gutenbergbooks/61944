FOREWORD</h2></div>


<p>The staff of life is not bread&mdash;it is
<i>breath</i>. For you can live days without
drink, and weeks without food. But you
can only live a few minutes without air.</p>

<p>You would think, inasmuch as the
human race has been breathing for at
least five hundred thousand years, that
men and women today would know <i>how</i>
to breathe.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, consciously
controlled breathing is known
to but very few people. These few fortunate
individuals have been rewarded
by Nature in the way Nature always rewards
those who follow her laws.</p>

<p>She blesses them with magnificent
constitutions, tireless energy and the
strength and beauty that comes from
radiant health; skin that shows the rich
blood flowing under its clear surfaces,
sparkling eyes, and the vivacious manner
that attracts and holds the attention
of men and women alike.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>This, Nature does for those who use
rightly her great gift.</p>

<p>Of the few in all the world who know
the inmost secrets of the art of breathing,
Edward Lankow, the talented author
of this course, is perhaps the greatest.</p>

<p>The Editor of Physical Culture Magazine
says of him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Edward Lankow is rated by
many critics as the greatest basso in
America. The richness, resonance, depth,
power, flexibility and cello-like beauty
of his voice has not been duplicated in
America for years. Mr. Lankow is thirty-five
years old; weight, 205 pounds
stripped; height 6 feet, 1-1/2 inches; chest
44-1/2 inches; waist, 38 inches. He is Russian-American,
born in Tarrytown, N. Y.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1902, at the age of nineteen, Lankow
was offered the principle Bass engagement
with the &#8220;Bostonians&#8221; by
Barnabee and MacDonald, which he declined
on account of a desire for further
study. The same year he was offered a
Tour with Adelina Patti, which he declined
for the same reason. In 1906 he
started his career in Europe, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
sang at all the principle opera houses,
and in concerts. In 1911 he returned to
America and made his debut on the
opening evening of the season with the
Boston Opera Company. Before going
to Boston, he studied Pelleas et Mellisande
in Paris, at the first rehearsal at
which the famous composer Debussy
was present, he received the superlative
compliment from the composer, who
said to him &#8220;In your voice, I hear for the
first the mystic timbre of voice I
thought of when I composed the part
fifteen years ago.&#8221; Mr. Lankow sang all
the nine performances of this opera in
Boston with Mme. Leblanc and Mary
Garden.</p>

<p>In 1912-1913 at the first performance
of the Magic Flute at the Metropolitan
Opera House, the management brought
Mr. Lankow over from Boston for the
first half dozen performances, where
three of the New York newspaper critics
pronounced him the greatest basso in
America&mdash;one critic saying &#8220;A voice of
amazing beauty, he is by long odds the
greatest basso in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>In April, 1917, while attending a garden
party at Governor&#8217;s Island, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Lankow noticed that the speaking voice
of Colonel Hartman was naturally exceedingly
well placed (or resonant) and
asked the Colonel if he had studied to
produce it that way. To which the
Colonel answered, &#8220;No, I always spoke
that way, and always wanted to find out
how I did it so as to show it to younger
officers&mdash;but I couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Lankow then showed the Colonel
by pressing his hand on the Colonel&#8217;s
abdomen how by Nature he used that
organ in support&mdash;a support which most
of us had to learn but which came quite
natural to him. The quick mind of
Colonel Hartman absorbed the value of
the idea at once, and he asked Mr. Lankow
to teach this subject at Camp Gorden,
Ga., the largest development camp
in the country.</p>

<p>Here official instructors of various
subjects from all the other camps in the
country from Maine to San Francisco
were gathered for special instructions&mdash;from
6.45 A. M. Mr. Lankow would
have classes ranging from 25 to 1100,
and gradually developed 41 officer assistant
instructors, so that several thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
men were doing the work at the
same time. The Commanding General,
Brigadier General William Sage and all
of his staff were in his morning class.</p>

<p>After the third week, Mr. Lankow
was asked to mess at Headquarters, and
live at the former home of Brigadier
General Shaw. The results of his work
were more than astounding.</p>

<p>Men who had apparently no voices at
all, and who had pain in the throat while
giving commands, suddenly found that
it was a pleasure to use the voice. On
the other hand, men whose health was
run down so that they were on their way
to forced retirement, were so changed
in appearance that their civilian friends
asked them what they were doing.</p>

<p>Surgeon General Rupert Blue thought
so highly of the health-building power
of Mr. Lankow&#8217;s course of instruction
that he made the following statement
to Mr. Lankow in Washington:</p>

<p>&#8220;Use my name for anything you like
in connection with your system of
teaching breath control.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another health authority said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Give the world two generations of
children taught this trained, scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
method of breathing and you&#8217;ll make
the community free of consumption.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many of the world&#8217;s greatest singers
have profited by Mr. Lankow&#8217;s instructions.
Mary Garden, Director of the
Chicago Opera Company and famous
prima donna, has written &#8220;Half the
world does not know that correct
breathing means health, happiness and
contentment. I had the joy of learning
this truth from Mr. Lankow. Every day
my voice became better&mdash;and my health
too. His work is <i>really great</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this complete course of &#8220;Lessons&#8221;
Mr. Lankow tells all the secrets of his
wonderful work.</p>

<p>Within a few days you, too, by following
the simple directions Mr. Lankow
advises, may be well on the road to such
health, strength, mental clearness and
physical beauty as you have never
known before.</p>

<p>For you will be working in harmony
with Nature&mdash;and with Nature&#8217;s great
and beneficent laws.</p>

<i>LESSON I</i><br />

Importance of Consciously Controlled
Breathing</h2></div>


<p>Air is truly the breath of life. It is
the vital fluid that animates our being;
that stimulates into activity every one
of the billion of cells that go to make up
<b>the body</b>.</p>

<p>It is a fact, conceded by every scientific
man today, that the oxygen in the
air we breathe is absolutely the greatest
purifying force in all Nature.</p>

<p>Yet there is but one way to get oxygen
into your lungs and into your system&mdash;and
this is to breathe it in.</p>

<p>As long ago as two thousand years
before the Christian Era, the Chinese
and the Hindoos made elaborate studies
in the art of breathing. Indeed, they
developed a complex science having to
do with control of the breath. Certain
forms of breathing were employed for
the cure of various diseases. Thus, for
example, it was believed that controlled
inhalations and exhalations would allay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
fevers; or, in a contrary condition of the
body, induce a salutary rise in temperature.</p>

<p>In India the Buddhist priests were at
pains to practice breath-control so as
always to command deep, quiet action of
the lungs. In this measured breathing
the number of breaths was greatly reduced.
The usual eighteen to twenty-two
breaths per minute were reduced to
six or eight. Experience justified the
theories of the priests concerning the
value of a controlled breathing. Its
merits have stood the tests of ages, and
today, in the Orient proper, breathing
is still deemed the fountain of health.</p>

<p>Aside from the distinctly physical advantages
derived from breath-control,
there results also a poise of mind that is
most desirable in its benefits to the
whole nature of the man.</p>

<p>Later in history both the Greeks and
the Romans practiced controlled breathing
for hygienic purposes and for the
attainment of bodily perfection. They
even went further than the Orientals of
an earlier epoch, for they deliberately
set out to enlarge the chest cavity. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
realized that the principal part of the
body is the trunk, and that in this the
chief constituent is the chest. The success
they attained in the development of
superb physiques is demonstrated by the
examples that survived to us of their
classic art. They were able to attain a
bodily perfection unequaled in the history
of the world. In their methods,
controlled breathing was the chief
agent.</p>

<p>In Europe, during the Middle Ages,
this science of breath suffered from increasing
neglect, and finally died out.</p>

<p>As an appalling commentary on the
neglect of proper breathing by the mass
of mankind, we may consider the fact,
now generally admitted by the medical
profession, that fully one half of the
world&#8217;s death-rate is due to consumption.</p>

<p>The fact could hardly be otherwise.
Any experienced physician is well aware
that only a small part of the lungs is
ordinarily used by the average person.
A large portion of the breathing apparatus
is in most cases never employed at
all. Naturally, inevitably, such areas in
the lungs weaken and become degenerate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
They offer a breeding place for the
germs of various infections.</p>


<h3>Why Ordinary Systems of Exercise Fail</h3>

<p>The various systems of gymnastics
are designed for the surface-building of
the body. The exercises affect almost
exclusively the outer muscular structure.
The scientific cultivation of the
breath, on the contrary, acts directly on
the inner, vital organs. These are
strengthened and developed from the
outset. Thus a sure foundation is laid
on which to build toward physical perfection,
and the true beauty which is, or
should be, the heritage of every healthy
man or woman. Any ordinary method
must of necessity prove itself as ineffective
as it is illogical.</p>

<p>The majority of athletes exhibit exterior
muscles of most impressive bulk.
It is a curious fact, however, that the
bony structure, which measures the
chest cavity, shows only a trifling development
when deprived of its muscular
support. It must always be borne
in mind that the strength of the body
lies in its organic power&mdash;not in the surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
muscles. In fact, the larger the
surface muscles are, the more strength
is taken from the organic vitality in
order to support and feed them. It is by
reason of this drain upon the inner
forces that athletes so often die young.
Abnormal development of the muscular
system at the expense of organic vitality
is a folly always dangerous, often fatal.</p>


<h3>How We Live On Air</h3>

<p>Air is the substance on which principally
we feed. What we eat is of secondary
importance. The purity of the
blood and the strength of the arteries
through which it throbs depend absolutely
upon right breathing. The greater
the quantity of air taken into the lungs,
the more oxygen for the purification of
the blood&mdash;the constant and prime requirement
for health.</p>

<p>The system of breathing which I advocate
in this work is not a mere matter
of theory, something vague and experimental.
It is concrete; it is exact;
its worth has been definitely proved.
I have demonstrated the merit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
exercises in my own case. During a year
and a half of practice my chest measurement
increased from thirty-eight inches
to forty-two.</p>


<h3>Breathing Color Into Pale Faces</h3>

<p>With many flat-chested and anemic
girls I have seen an equally astonishing
improvement. I have seen their chest
develop, their busts become firm and
rounded, and tell-tale hollows under
their collar bones fill out.</p>

<p>Almost invariably, flabby muscles become
resilient, pale sallow cheeks become
pink with the sweet flush of
healthy youth.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I have discovered a variety
of virtues in controlled breathing. Thus,
in the case of that most annoying among
minor ailments, a cold, I have found that
I could invariably be rid of it within
twenty-four hours by means of strenuous
breathing exercises for twenty minutes
at a time repeated often during the
day.</p>

<p>For a more formal indorsement of
this system, I may refer to the Societe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Internationale de la Tuberculose. An
investigation by the society was reported
favorably at The Hague and London.</p>

<p>In this connection, it should be remembered
that the world at large has
not yet begun to realize the supreme
value of correct, quiet, slow breathing
for general health. Its practice regularly
would unquestionably prove a
preventative of tubercular disease. Its
judicious employment by those already
affected would prove a powerful
remedial agent. Consumptives who seek
the pure air of mountains or plains often
fail to receive benefit, for the simple
reason that they have never learned the
proper manner of breathing. To such,
the best of air is useless as the most
nourishing food to the one who has no
teeth with which to chew.</p>

<p>When one inhales, the lungs seem to
grow. As the cells are filled with air,
the chest proportionately enlarges. At
the same time, the ribs and the diaphragm
assume a new position. The
result is that the chest, the between-rib
muscles, and the diaphragm are all very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
strenuously exercised. By proper breathing,
the various muscles involved are
constantly trained; they are developed
and made elastic to such an extent that
the lungs are not required to stand alone
in their resistance against adverse conditions,
both without and within.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The lungs expand during inhalation;
they contract during exhalation. A full
breath dilates the lungs to their maximum
capacity; they relax to the minimum
size when the breath is completely
expelled. By practice one can readily
learn to influence the various movements,
and gradually to control them.
The practice of the first exercises in the
series given includes sudden exhalation,
slow exhalation, and rhythmic exhalation.
These tend to reduce the quantity
of air that is left in the lungs when the
breath is expelled. Such residual air is
poisonous, and an excess of it, due to improper
breathing, is very injurious. Its
retention in the lung cells not only lessens
the space available to be filled with
fresh air, but it also acts as a direct
agent for ill in the bodily processes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>


<h3>How Consciously Controlled Breathing
Makes You Resist Disease</h3>

<p>It should be added, and with emphasis,
that <i>the habit of deep breathing makes
one immune to the germs of various
diseases</i>. The practice of breath-control
gives a toughened fiber to the whole
breathing apparatus. This and the constant
purifying of the blood develop the
body&#8217;s vital forces to the highest degree
possible, against which disease is rendered
powerless. Thus one may enter
into possession of the health and
strength that are his by right; and thus,
and thus only, shall he know the joy of
life.</p>

<p>Here is an illustration of what may
be done by serious and persistent attention
to breathing. It must be understood,
however, that I by no means advise
others to follow my example, although
I believe it quite possible for anybody&mdash;man,
woman, boy or girl&mdash;by constant
practice, to develop the same perfect resistance
that I myself have.</p>

<p>For a period of five years, I have made
it a rule to dress in January exactly as
in July&mdash;except in the matter of an overcoat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
I go without underclothing, I
wear no waistcoat, (vest). I do not take
exception to the wearing by others of
such garments, during the winter
months. But for myself, as I gradually
learned to take advantage of systematic
breathing exercises and thus to charge
my blood abundantly with oxygen, the
necessity for much clothing disappeared.
Underwear grew to be uncomfortable. I
found myself both happier and healthier
without it. When I wore the heavier
clothing in winter, I suffered from frequent
colds. Now I am rarely troubled
in that manner. If, through carelessness,
I do catch cold, I am able easily to
throw it off within twenty-four hours
by means of extra practice in deep
breathing, together with a short fast.</p>

<p>I do not wish to infer that the heavier
clothing is the cause of colds. My point
is, rather, that the extra amount of oxygen
I take into my blood supplies the
place of the garments formerly worn by
me, as well as acts in consuming, or
burning up, the poisonous material that
gathers in the tissues, and tends to make
you <i>feel</i> cold.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Let me repeat that I do not advise
anyone to experiment with the wearing
of summer apparel in winter until after
several months of systematic breathing
exercises, with the consequent enriching
of the blood. The matter, like that of
the cold bath, is one for individual discrimination.</p>

<p>In my own case, the lighter garb has
become actually a necessity for comfort&#8217;s
sake.</p>


<h3>Why We Should Establish Schools To
Teach The New Science of Breathing</h3>

<p>Whatever the different systems for
muscular and health development may
be, the value of developing those vital
inner organs&mdash;the heart, the lungs and
the digestive organs, is easily understood.
A large arm, or a wonderful leg
development cannot help these inner
organs, if they are naturally weak, or if
they have been weakened. The point is&mdash;what
<i>will</i> give health to these organs
the fundamental or motor power to all
health.</p>

<p>Special exercises for the lungs, that
is, conscious deep breathing exercises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
for a specific period of time, will give
results which few realize. It is all so
simple that most of us cannot believe it,
like all truths. The maximum oxygenation
of the blood through taking in
large quantities of air&mdash;thereby feeding
the organs with purer blood&mdash;the
<i>improved circulation</i>, the exhilarated
heartbeat, the drawing away of drowsiness
from the brain, <i>the improved digestion
through the unconscious massage
of the lower organs</i>, all these will show
what results are obtainable. If the
children in our schools were taught conscious,
deep, slow breathing at that
period of their lives when body and mind
are flexible, the habit would be easily
formed for life. This habit would surely
wipe out consumption within two generations.
Millions of human beings die
yearly from this, the greatest human
menace. Why not, therefore, have
schools for breathing. Surely this experiment
is entitled to a place among
the hundreds of other experiments
which have been and which are being
tried.</p>
